# Master in Cognitive Systems

This is a distance-learning program taught exclusively on-line in collaboration with the Open University of Cyprus and the Department of Psychology of the University of Cyprus. The program is taught in English.

Cognitive systems form a new generation of systems that aim to collaborate with their users at a level cognitively compatible with a non-computing expert in order to provide personalized and adaptive services, with each party, system and human, learning and adapting to the capabilities of the other. The need for developing such cognitive systems has been widely recognized. The Watson machine opened up the area of Cognitive Computing and we see today the development of the first Cognitive Assistants such as Siri, Cortana, Alexa, Google Assistant and others from every major computing company in the world.

Students are required to take:

* 3 first courses under the Foundations theme (COS511, COS512, COS513), where at least the two introductory courses (COS511, COS512) are expected to be taken during the first semester.
* electives among all other courses, as long as at least one third of the courses comes from Cognitive Psychology (CP), and one third of the courses come from Computer Science (CS).
