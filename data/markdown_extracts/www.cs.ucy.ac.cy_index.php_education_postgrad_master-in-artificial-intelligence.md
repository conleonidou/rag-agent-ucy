The MSc Artificial Intelligence programme brings together the expertise of two departments in the University of Cyprus – Computer Science, and Electrical and Computer Engineering – to prepare the next generation of AI experts. The programme is delivered in English; its development was co-funded by the European Union (Connecting Europe Facility (CEF) — Telecommunications Sector). Europe’s initiative to fund new master’s programmes in Artificial Intelligence demonstrates the importance Europe attaches to recent developments in this area, in providing solutions to global problems related to every aspect of human life, contributing to growth and competitiveness. Europe urgently needs more professionals in Artificial Intelligence, entrepreneurs, and researchers, capable of paving the way for new innovations for the good of society and pushing the borders of the field towards new challenges. This new generation of AI graduates must be fully familiar with the latest technological developments in terms of the breadth and depth of technical knowledge in Artificial Intelligence, be connected to industry and be fully aware of the ethical issues involved.

The MSc Artificial Intelligence is a modern programme, containing a strong interdisciplinary element as required by human-centric, explainable, and responsible artificial intelligence. Its compulsory courses include courses on artificial intelligence and ethics, as well as on artificial intelligence and entrepreneurship. Providing career counselling to students is a high priority, with the aim of helping all graduates to successfully pursue an AI-related career, possibly set up their own start-ups. Fostering strong links with industry provides significant added value to the educational experience.

The programme’s intended learning outcomes are the following:

**Foundational Principles of Intelligent Systems** – Understanding the fundamental principles defining software systems with ‘intelligent’ behaviour and stay informed about the latest advancements in AI.

**Holistic Understanding of Machine Learning** – Acquire a comprehensive view of machine learning principles driving scientific and industrial AI innovations.

**Entrepreneurial Insight in AI and Data** – Master key concepts and challenges relevant to AI and data-driven entrepreneurship.

**Practical Applications and Ethical Considerations** – Apply AI research methods and tools, considering professional practices, regulatory frameworks and AI ethics.

**Mandatory Courses**

* AI Fundamentals
* Machine Learning
* Research Methodologies and Professional Practices in AI
* AI on the Edge Webinars
* AI Ethics and Policy Making
* AI Entrepreneurship

**Elective Courses**

* Industrial/research internship
* Natural Language Processing
* AI in Medicine
* Deep Learning
* Computer Vision
* Machine Learning for Graphics and Computer Vision

* Human-centered intelligent user interfaces
* Principles of Ontological Databases
* Internet of Things
* Big Data Analytics
* Data Visualization
* Cloud Computing
* Embedded and Real-Time Systems
* Intelligent Monitoring and Control
* Autonomous Mobile Robots

**MSc Thesis can be replaced with 2 elective courses**

The programme consists of **three academic semesters (90 ECTS credits)** and an intervening summer period during which students can optionally embark on an industrial/research internship (8 ECTS credits) or complete their Master thesis. An internship, based on evaluation, can be counted as one of the elective courses. An ever-expanding network of industrial and research organizations linked with the programme, provides students and graduates the opportunity to pursue AI-related internships on cutting edge themes, do an industrial-based Master thesis, or being offered employment. Internships can also be conducted through Erasmus+ placements utilizing academic and other international partners.

The programme can be attended on a full-time, or a part-time, basis; students can organize their studying accordingly with the help of their academic tutors. To facilitate working students, no lectures or other learning activities are scheduled during morning sessions.

**Admission Criteria**

* A bachelor’s degree in pure/applied sciences (computer science, informatics, mathematics, etc.) or engineering (e.g. computer engineering, biomedical engineering) or cognitive science
* Reasonable exposure to AI background topics gained through previous studies or work experience, as well as knowledge of computer programming
* Fluency in the English language

**Several scholarships covering half the amount of tuition fees are available.**
