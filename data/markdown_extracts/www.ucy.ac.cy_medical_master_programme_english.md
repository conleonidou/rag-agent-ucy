| **PROGRAMME OVERVIEW**    **Purpose of the programme**   * To offer postgraduate specialist education on precision medicine to healthcare professionals and biomedical sciences graduates, Cypriots, and international students * To promote research in this contemporary and currently expanding field * To improve the knowledge and understanding of health professionals and associated fields’ specialists in an area of medicine with immediate impact in clinical practice, ultimately improving the level of clinical services wherever needed   **Objectives of the programme**   * Comprehension of and competence in the principles of a number of relevant medical fields including: Clinical trials, genetics, molecular diagnostics, pharmacology, statistics, analytics, ethics * Understanding and application of the concepts of precision medicine in clinical practice   **Intended learning outcomes of the programme**  The student is expected to become familiar with the principles and the concepts of precision and personalized medicine on the following:   * Statistics and informatics as a tool to study different diseases in a way that produces evidence-based results * Design, development, and conduct of clinical trials * Pharmacology targeted therapies, and pharmacogenomics * Ethics in clinical and basic precision research * Genetic, molecular, and cellular basis of diseases * Contemporary methods of diagnostics * Examples of applicability (current and future) of precision medicine in different fields of clinical medicine  **Modules**  The programme consists of 8 compulsory modules and the thesis. Four modules will be offered in Semester A, and four modules in Semester B whilst the thesis project will be offered in Semester C. Out of the 8 modules, two will be autonomous offering the choice of specific subjects to the students. The purpose and objectives of the modules are:  **1.Introduction to medical statistics and research methodologies**  To familiarize students with principles and concepts of medical statistics, informatics, and research methodology  **2.Clinical Trials (essentials and beyond)**  To familiarize students with the principles and concepts of clinical trials, and to equip them with the necessary knowledge and skills so as to work in this field and make valuable contributions to the conduct of clinical research  **3.Pharmacology and Pharmacogenomics**  To provide students with a solid platform of knowledge in fundamental pharmacological and toxicological concepts, as well as pharmacogenomics in relation to dynamics and kinetics and the applicability of these data in precision medicine  **4.Ethical problems and dilemmas in precision medicine (Autonomous 1)**  Through literature search, the student is expected to identify and subsequently discuss in the form of an essay, the ethical issues and dilemmas arising from the application of precision medicine in clinical practice  **5.Special Topics in Human Molecular and Medical Genetics I**  Familiarization with the main properties of the human genome and understanding of the molecular basis of hereditary disorders  **6.Molecular Diagnostics**  Introduction to the field of molecular diagnostic methodology and how it is used in contemporary clinical practice for the diagnosis of diseases in the context of precision medicine  **7.Clinical applications of precision medicine**  To offer students insights into the concepts and principles of the applications of precision medicine in clinical practice  **8.Case studies in precision medicine (Autonomous 2)**  This module’s purpose is the description, discussion, and subsequently the analysis of the components of various aspects of precision medicine, in the form of case studies    **ADMISSION CRITERIA**  The candidates will be asked to:   1. Present their full curriculum vitae 2. Present a Bachelor degree from an accredited university 3. Have previous university education in a suitable and relevant field (academic background) and sufficient grades in the associated subjects:     – Previous relevant and suitable background includes a degree in : medicine, nursery, biomedical sciences, biological sciences, pharmacological sciences, computational biology, biochemical sciences, molecular sciences, or other relevant fields     – A minimum Upper Second-Class Honours (>60%) degree is required     – In associated subjects (within the previous degree) grades of >60% are required 4. Have good knowledge of the English language. This is defined by the criteria set by CYQAA (September 2020) 5. Present letters of recommendation. The letters of recommendation are to be provided by at least 2 referees, one of which should preferably be one of the   candidate’s professors at their previous degree(s) 6. In their short statement (maximum 2 pages) candidates should present their motivation to study Precision Medicine at a postgraduate level at UCY and the relevance to their future plans and how this degree may impact their career     **Multilevel Benefits for the graduates**   * Clinical applicability in different fields of medicine, therefore relevance to daily clinical practice * Exposure to knowledge and experience in fields currently in expansion in Cyprus i.e. clinical trials * Implementation of state-of-the-art practices in their work or scientific endeavors by the acquirement of transferable skills * Student-driven learning approach: students to incorporate their needs/ experiences in the programme * Expansion of research activity in Cyprus or abroad * Increase of employability in health associated appointments     **Academic and Teaching staff**   * The academics and collaborators teaching in this postgraduate programme belong to the staff of the University of Cyprus.
