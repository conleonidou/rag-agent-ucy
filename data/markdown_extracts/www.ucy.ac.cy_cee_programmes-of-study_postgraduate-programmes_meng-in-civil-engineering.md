#### **Profile of Programme**

The Master of Engineering (M.Eng.) in Civil Engineering is offered in four specializations as listed below; to specialize in any of these areas the graduate must fulfil certain course and research work requirements:

1. Structural Analysis and Earthquake Engineering
2. Novel and Traditional Construction Materials
3. Geotechnical Engineering
4. Construction and Transport Infrastructure Management

More specifically, for the Master of Engineering degree (M.Eng.) courses are grouped in four categories of courses, from which each student must successfully attend a specific number of courses in order to fulfil the requirements of the specialty thrust selected, as follows:

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| **Categories** | **Description** |
| Α | Basic specialization graduate courses |
| Β | Elective specialization graduate courses |
| C | CEE graduate courses other than those in categories A and B |
| D | UCY graduate courses |

For the Master of Engineering degree (M.Eng.) in Civil Engineering, for each of the five thrusts, a number of successfully completed courses is required, as follows:

|  |  |  |  |  |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| C**ourses:** | **A** | **B** | **C** | **D** |
| M.Eng. | ≥5 | ≤5 | ≤1 | ≤1 |
| M.Sc. | ≥ 4 | ≤3 | ≤1 | |

Therefore, completion of an M.Eng. degree in Civil Engineering in any particular thrust which requires successful passing of 10 graduate courses, the requirements correspond to at least 5 graduate courses from group A and up to 5 graduate courses from group B, while up to 1 course is allowed from group C and up to 1 course from group D, as specified for the particular of specialization. For example, a student could take 6 courses from group A and 4 courses from group B, or 5 courses from group A, 4 courses from group B and 1 course from group C or D, as specified for the particular specialization.

#### **Key Learning Outcomes**

The program aims at providing the students with novel knowledge and aspires to educate them to:

* develop critical thinking,
* seek continuous professional development,
* introduce and adopt innovative concepts/ideas, technologies and methods in their practice,
* accept interdisciplinary collaborations for the holistic approach and efficient
* solving of the problems considering the environment.

#### **Conditions of Study**

Specific Admission Requirements

The number of places available are announced by the Graduate School with the eligibility criteria for candidates, as well as other required documents that must be attached to the application such as:
- Bachelor’s degree from a recognised University.
- Previous University education in a suitable subject (academic background) and grades of relevant degrees.
- Letters of recommendation.
- Personal interview and/or written examination (if provided by the Department’s internal rules).
The Department may also set additional criteria and quality indicators such as: (a) number of students’ publications in scientific journals, (b) students’ participation in seminars, symposia, research programmes, (c) presentations by students at conferences, (d) knowledge of foreign languages, and (e) professional experience, etc.

Rules of Study

Students must always advise the University's [Postgraduate Study Rules](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/graduateschool/documents/Kanones/RULES_METAPTIXIAKIS_FOITISIS_ENGLISH1.pdf).

Graduation Requirements

Successful completion of the requirements of the Programme.

Examination Regulations

Please advise [Postgraduate Study Rules](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/graduateschool/documents/Kanones/RULES_METAPTIXIAKIS_FOITISIS_ENGLISH1.pdf).

Assessment and Grading

The grading system is numerical, from 0 to 10 with increments of ½. The minimum passing grade is 5. The final grade of a graduate student is calculated as the grade point average of all courses passed by the student.
In a postgraduate programme of study, courses can be graded as Success/Failure. These courses do not count towards the student’s GPA, and may not exceed 25% of the programme’s ECTS, with the exception of the dissertation units. All courses are presented in the Postgraduate Studies Prospectus.
The diploma dissertation, thesis, research and writing stages are graded with Success / Failure. The final grade of the dissertation is registered in the last semester of its elaboration. Master level dissertations are calculated qualitatively as Excellent, Very Good, Good, and Failure.

### **Further Information**

#### **Occupational Profiles of Graduates with Examples**

There are professional opportunities for civil and environmental engineers in both private practice and public services. Graduates from the Master’s program in “Civil Engineering” may pursue careers in design, construction, maintenance, management or research and development. For example, in urban or developing population areas and industrial centres, civil and environmental engineers serve the public as planners, designers, and supervisors of transportation systems, water resources projects, pollution control facilities, private and public utility enterprises.

#### **Access to Further Studies**

Graduates can be admitted to Doctoral Programmes.
