## Testimonials

  > ![](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/mba/wp-content/uploads/sites/163/2023/06/p1-300x253.png)*Studying for my MBA at UCY was a transformative and life-changing experience. The learning process of the Program is formed through a unique combination of exceptional knowledge taught in class, top-notch Professors who go beyond teaching to serve as mentors and the structure of the curriculum itself. Through this journey, I have enhanced my communication and leadership skills, unlocked my entrepreneurial potential, learned how to better focus my energy and how to master time. In the search for discovering the limits of one’s capabilities, the UCY MBA offers, not just another step, but a giant leap*

  > *![](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/mba/wp-content/uploads/sites/163/2023/06/p4.png)I chose the MBA Programme of the University of Cyprus as it satisfied my needs and criteria. My MBA studies at UCY helped me to view managerial functions from a different perspective, and to draw relations with my organizational setting, based on my prior experience.  Many of the subjects taught, the assignments and projects I completed during my MBA studies, have proved very useful in my professional work, particularly now that I have managed to become the first female Director of PWD since its establishment. My UCY MBA degree was a strong asset in my ascent to the Directorship. The Program was demanding, but also highly rewarding; it helped me develop a broad perspective of policies and management issues, which are of paramount importance in my present position.*
