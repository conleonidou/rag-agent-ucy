# MA programmes

The Department of English Studies offers postgraduate programmes at the master level, leading to an MA. All MA programmes are watched over by a three-member committee, which is appointed every two years. The Committee is chaired by a Postgraduate Coordinator. The different MA programmes do not necessarily run every year. Please, check on the relevant announcements of the [**Graduate School**](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/graduateschool/) for updated information.

The relevant announcements of the Graduate School also contain full information on the application period, the number of students to be admitted to each programme, the admission requirements and the application procedure. Generally, all applicants for entrance in the MA programmes must hold a first class or upper second class degree (or equivalent) in a subject related to their proposed field of study. All candidates must be competent and fluent in English and, depending on the nature of the programme, in other relevant languages. Although candidates need not have completed their degree at the time of application, they must have received it before they are allowed to commence the postgraduate programmes.

[**MA in TEACHING ENGLISH TO SPEAKERS OF OTHER LANGUAGES (TESOL)**](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/eng/programmes-of-study/ma-programmes/postgraduate-programmes/)

The programme is primarily designed for those interested in TESOL as an academic field and has the following main objectives:

* To offer students a solid foundation and deepen their knowledge in the main areas of TESOL, from both a theoretical and a practical point of view.
* To acquaint students with new areas in the field (such as computer-assisted language learning, alternative assessment, English as a lingua franca).
* To engage students in research in the field of TESOL and consequently encourage them to further their studies.

The programme is divided into two components: The taught component covers the main areas of TESOL and familiarises students with research methodology; the thesis component gives students the opportunity to undertake research in a specialised area of interest.

[**MA in ENGLISH STUDIES**](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/eng/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2024/11/MA-in-English-Studies_Program-Guide.pdf)

The MA in English Studies is designed for students who wish to pursue advanced study and research in English Studies. Drawing from the fields of literary and cultural studies, translation studies, and the study of the English language, the program balances theoretical and practical concerns, providing graduate students with a holistic understanding of hermeneutic and pedagogical issues of interpretation and transmission. It offers:

* an extensive focus on theoretically and historically informed perspectives on literature;
* a particular focus on the role of the interlingual and intercultural transfer of literary texts through translation and adaptation; and
* a vital background in the philosophy and practice of language.

The wide range of courses on offer highlights the interdisciplinary, inter-generic and cross-cultural dimensions of contemporary literary, linguistic, and cultural studies within the Anglophone context. The progamme guide can be found [here](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/eng/wp-content/uploads/sites/18/2024/11/MA-in-English-Studies_Program-Guide.pdf).

**Structure**

The MA in English Studies covers four semesters of study. Students are required to register for three courses (of 10 ECTS each) in each of the first three semesters of study. Two of these courses in each of the first three semesters are restricted electives that will be drawn from a list of broader rubrics that represent the philosophy and objectives of the programme. These course offerings may vary from one cycle of the MA to another, but by the end of the third semester, students will have taken a minimum of one course from each of the four rubrics. The fourth semester of study involves the writing of an MA thesis under the guidance of an assigned supervisor.
