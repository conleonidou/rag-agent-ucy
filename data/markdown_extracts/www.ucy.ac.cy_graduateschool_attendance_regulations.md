Certification of Attendance

At the end of the third week of each semester, a Certification of Attendance is issued to all registered postgraduate students. Students, must have this Certification to receive the annual education grant given by the Ministry of Finance in the Spring Semester.
Students wishing to obtain additional certificates should apply to the Academic Affairs and Student Welfare Service.  The cost for additional certifications is €2 .

Grading System

The awarding of grades is the exclusive right of the professor. Changes of grades by the professor are possible only in cases of an error and only with the written approval of the Chairperson of Department and the Dean of the relevant Faculty, no later than 15 days after publication of the grades. If the change proposed by the professor is made later than 15 days, approval is required from the Graduate School.

The grading system is numerical, from 0 to 10 with increments of ½. The minimum passing grade is 5. The final grade of a graduate student is calculated as the grade point average of all courses passed by the student with the exception of the grade of the Master's thesis which is not counted in the final weighted average of the student's grade. The GPA is based on the ECTS of each course.

In a postgraduate programme of study, courses can be graded as Success/Failure. These courses do not count towards the student’s GPA, and may not exceed 25% of the programme’s ECTS, with the exception of the dissertation units. All courses are presented in the Postgraduate Studies Prospectus.

The grading of a Master's dissertation or thesis which takes one or more semesters to complete, is as follows: At the end of each semester and within the deadline set by the Academic affairs and Student Welfare Service, the supervising professor submits the student’s grade in the electronic system (Success or Failure).

The final grade for the dissertation is delivered within the deadline set for all courses and is filed in the last semester of its preparation. Master level dissertations are graded qualitatively as Excellent, Very Good, Good, and Failure or with a numerical grade (per 1/2 of the unit and with a minimum threshold of success Grade 5). The doctoral dissertation is graded as Success or Failure.

The analytical grades for all courses, as well as any possible failures, withdrawals, recognitions, or exemptions from courses, are recorded in the student’s final transcript of grades. The grade average for each course in ECTS numbers is contained in the Department’s Prospectus and the transcript of grades. In addition, all Master’s degree graduates receive a free Diploma Supplement in English language.

Students are entitled to ask for clarifications from the professor regarding matters of their final grades. If the professor refuses to discuss the matter with the student, the student has the right to ask for them from the Department Chairman.

Plagiarism

**Plagiarism**: the appropriation and/or incorporation in a paper of ideas whether verbatim or paraphrased, extracts and/or isolated phrases of the work of another person without reference to the source or through misleading or inadequate reference to the primary source.

Field of commission of offence: Plagiarism is committed when the intellectual work of another person is published or delivered in the form of a paper in printed and/or electronic form, with a view to fulfilling the obligations undertaken by a student in the framework of the evaluation process. It also covers cases of handling university notes without the permission of their creator and the professor.

Collusion: The submission and presentation of work as the product of exclusively individual work completed solely by a student, whereas it was written in cooperation with other students. Collusion also exists when a student, in the framework of fulfilling obligations undertaken for a specific evaluation procedure, re-submits work, either wholly or partly written by the student him/herself for the need of a different procedure.

Plagiarism/Collusion in Examinations This is defined as the failure to fulfil an evaluation procedure in a personal, self-reliant and independent way, as determined by the academic staff through the method of examinations. This includes the use during examinations of any kind of cheating/cribbing, non-permitted cooperation with third parties and the use of aids and/or notes which have not been approved in advance by the professor. It also includes impersonation of a person by another person who undertakes to fulfil the obligations arising from the examination process by pretending to be a specific student. When extracts are used from the published or unpublished works of another person full reference must be made to the relevant sources. The use of a series of short extracts from different sources without reference to them constitutes equally serious plagiarism as copying, without citation, from one source, of a large excerpt. When a student summarises the ideas or opinions of a person, reference must be made to the name of that person in the text and the title of the relevant book, article or other work must be cited in the bibliography.

Grade improvement

Students wishing to improve their grades in a course in which they received a grade of at least 5, may repeat the course only once. The analytic transcript of grades will contain both grades, but for the calculation of the final grade the more recent grade will count. If the most recent grade is under 5, then the grade is counted as 5.

Failure in a course

In case of failure in a compulsory course, the student must repeat the course. In case of failure in an optional course, the student may repeat it or replace it with a different optional course.

An incomplete grade

An incomplete grade is given only in exceptional cases (e.g. proven medical or personal reasons). The procedure for incomplete grades is as follows:

* The professor, with the approval of the Department Chairman, informs the Graduate School in writing.
* A date is given for completion of the course requirements, which cannot be later than the end of the next semester.
* If the student has not completed the course requirements prior to the end of the next semester, the grade is automatically converted to zero

Postponement of Studies before beginning of semester

Any student may apply to postpone their studies for one or two semesters. The total period of postponement cannot exceed two semesters

An application for postponement, documented and accompanied by all supporting documents, is submitted to the Department Board before the beginning of the requested period

The Department Board examines the application and decides by simple majority whether or not to approve it

The Department Chairman informs the student in writing of the decision of the Department Board. The decision is communicated to the Dean of the Graduate School.

The procedure for granting a postponement must be completed by the end of the first week of classes, so that the students do not take up places in the courses and the Graduate School is able to be informed in good time in order to remove the courses from the students before the week of adding/dropping courses

A semester during which a student has postponed his/her studies is not counted as study time.

Maternity-Paternity Leave

Students may apply for maternity or paternity leave respectively, up to one year for mothers and up to one semester for fathers.

Students may apply for maternity or paternity leave with a medical certificate stating the estimated date of delivery. This is examined by the Department Board. The Chairman informs the student in writing of the Board’s decision which is also communicated to the Graduate School.

The leave is not counted in the total years of study.

Temporary Interruption of Studies Mid-Semester

A student may apply for Temporary Interruption of studies during the semester when there are serious medical reasons. The student applies to the Department, with notification to the Graduate School for approval. The Senate authorises the Dean of the Graduate School to approve requests.

Studies may be interrupted for up to two semesters and then the case is re-examined by the Graduate School. A semester where a student’s studies have been interrupted is not counted as part of their studies.

Student leaving from UCY

A postgraduate student wishing to leave the UCY programme of study in which he/she has enrolled, must inform the Department Council in writing. The Council’s decision is communicated to the Dean of the Graduate School.

Graduation Ceremony

The Graduation Ceremony is held in June. Both the graduates of the Fall and the Spring semester participate in this ceremony.

The Application Form for the Ceremony and the instructions for Graduation Ceremony are sent to all students who are expected to graduate and are announced on the website of the Graduate School.
