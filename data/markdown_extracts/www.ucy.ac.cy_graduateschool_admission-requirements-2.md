**Required Levels of English language proficiency for studies in Postgraduate Programmes:**

---

In accordance with the Cyprus Agency of Quality Assurance and Accreditation in Higher Education (CYQAA), for admission to programmes of study taught in the English language at postgraduate levels at universities, candidate students should provide a certificate of their knowledge of English.

For programs of study at the postgraduate level candidate students are required to have certification for “Very Good Knowledge” of English at level B2-C1 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR). At this level, the users can understand a wide range of demanding, long and complex texts, and recognize implied meanings. The users can express themselves fluently and spontaneously without much obvious searching for expressions. They can use the language flexibly and effectively for social, academic, and professional purposes. They can produce clear, well-structured, detailed texts on complex topics, demonstrating controlled use of organizational patterns, connecting elements, and coherence mechanisms.

Common European Framework of Reference for Languages (CEFR) corresponds to the following specific reference frameworks for international examinations, according to the official pages of the organizations offering these examinations. Indicatively, a score of 5.5 – 6.5 corresponds to knowledge of level B2 (Lower), while score 8.5-9 is level C2 (Proficiency).

Please note that some scores only remain valid for two years. If you apply using a certificate gained over two years ago, you will need to retake the test.

**Option for candidates coming from Third Countries (VALID FROM 01.12.2022):**

According to the 91.387/2021 decision of the Cabinet of the Republic of Cyprus, which is valid since 01.12.2022, there is an extra possibility for candidates coming from Third Countries and want to apply for a position in Universities and Colleges of the Republic. Namely, they are able from now to apply for entrance permit in the country, if they succeed in the Password Test Examination (Password Skills Test Plus edition).

Please, note that for their acceptance to a Postgraduate Programme, candidates must have a general grade of at least 5.5 on the particular examination.
