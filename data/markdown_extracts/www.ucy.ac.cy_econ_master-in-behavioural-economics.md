The MSc in Behavioural Economics is offered jointly by the [Department of Economics](https://www.ucy.ac.cy/econ/?lang=en) and the [Department of Psychology](https://newdev.ucy.ac.cy/psych/?lang=en).

It is designed to prepare students for career paths that require the analysis of human behavior (product/service design, human resources management, policy making etc.)

The program is aimed at students with backgrounds in economics, psychology, engineering, and other social, natural, or applied sciences, who wish to explore the questions at the boundaries of Economics and Psychology.

The program provides students with a general grounding in behavioural and experimental approaches to social sciences, and with skills and knowledge that are essential for the economic analysis of human behavior and the application of behavioral science to the resolution of contemporary societal challenges.

Successful graduates will acquire a solid grasp of key concepts and results in the area of behavioural sciences and develop the analytical and technical skills that are valued by academic and other organizations operating in today’s dynamic and complex settings of interaction.

They will be able to use insights drawn from recent studies to understand complex behavioural phenomena that are relevant to the organization’s performance and goals; to comprehend and suitably design the organization’s policies and to appropriately assess the associated risks and rewards; to design and execute studies examining the role of human behavior in contemporary socioeconomic phenomena, and to evaluate the outcomes of interventions, using cutting edge research techniques.

## Graduate's prospects

The programme is designed for students interested in seeking employment in public or private organizations in the fields of Behavioural analysis, marketing, consumer behaviour, product design, etc. Faculty in both departments maintains strong connections to national and international organizations and the private sector.

Additionally,our graduates will be able to follow academic paths leading to PhDs in Behavioural sciences and experimental Psychology/Economics. Both Departments have a strong tradition in fostering PhD programmes, and graduates of the Master in Behavioural Economics can be competitive applicants to these and other international programmes.
