The course will explore the features of complex thinking, provide the tools for developing it, and suggest ways in which complex thinking leads to reflective judgment.\\n\\nThinking becomes complex when it embraces uncertainty, accommodates paradox and allows for the ineffable; is dynamic and flexible; holistic, critical, and reflexive. Judgment becomes reflective when it is evidence-based and context-sensitive, while seeking unifying principles in the service of a good purpose. In this course, reflective judgment will be taken to be tantamount to practical wisdom (Aristotle’s phronesis). Developing reflective judgment, one needs to cope with paradoxes; reduce noise; grow a holistic and dynamic understanding of problems; get a proper grasp of intuition and insight, heuristics and biases; be in tune with one’s emotions; and sharpen critical thinking skills in ways that enable the disclosive framing of problems, namely, bringing to surface unspoken assumptions, hidden values, and the ethical dimension.

      "\n",
      "The capstone project has been designed to apply knowledge into practice and to develop and improve critical skills such as problem-solving and collaboration skills. Students are matched with research labs within the UCY community and with industry partners to investigate pressing issues, applying data science areas. Capstone projects aim to give students some professional experience in a real work environment and help enhance their soft skills.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process is the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "- A short description of projects are announced to students.\n",
      "- Students bid up to three projects taking into account the fields of their interest or research.\n",
      "- The data science directors make the final assignment of projects to students. The projects are under the supervision of a member of the Programme’s academic staff.\n",
      "- Specific learning outcomes are stipulated in a learning agreement between the student, the supervisor and the company.\n",
      "- The student keeps a log file of his/her work and at the end writes a progress report (6000 words).\n",
      "- The company is obliged to monitor the progress of the students and to provide relevant mentorship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Final assessment is carried out by the company and the supervisor.\n",

      "\n",
      "Students that would like to continue their studies and be enrolled in a PhD programme, have the option of an additional research project. This option will be made available only to exceptional students who have clearly demonstrated research interest during their studies. The Interdepartmental Board of Directors has the discretion of offering this option to specific students, provided appropriate supervisors have been found. Specifically, the research project option will be available to students who want to pursue doctoral studies in any area covered by the programme. Such students need to satisfy the respective departmental Ph.D. admission criteria, while the research project will replace a restricted elective course.\n",

      "- The procedure for defence of the dissertation consists of three stages: (a) presentation of the dissertation in an open lecture, (b) discussion of the dissertation with the members of the Examining Committee and (c) meeting of the Committee and formation of the Committee's final proposal.After completion of the dissertation defence , the Committee submits a detailed proposal to the Head of the department in writing with any recommendations to the candidate. The Head sends the Committee's proposal to the Senate for approval.\n",
      "- If the Committee suggests any changes or improvements, the Senate will grant final approval for the award of the degree after the Research Advisor confirms in writing that the suggestions have been implemented.\n",
      "- If the Examining Committee cannot recommend awarding a degree, the Ph.D. candidate may be allowed to resubmit the dissertation, after due modifications have been made in accordance with the committee's requirements, and repeat the entire process of defence once more.\n",
      "- Students at the doctoral level may be awarded a Master degree if for special reasons they need to interrupt their studies, provided that they fulfil the department's requirements.\n",

The final grade of a graduate student is calculated as the grade point average of all courses passed by the student with the exception of the grade of the Master's thesis which is not counted in the final weighted average of the student's grade. The GPA is based on the ECTS of each course.\n",

      "Field of commission of offence: Plagiarism is committed when the intellectual work of another person is published or delivered in the form of a paper in printed and/or electronic form, with a view to fulfilling the obligations undertaken by a student in the framework of the evaluation process.

This includes the use during examinations of any kind of cheating/cribbing, non-permitted cooperation with third parties and the use of aids and/or notes which have not been approved in advance by the professor. It also includes impersonation of a person by another person who undertakes to fulfil the obligations arising from the examination process by pretending to be a specific student. When extracts are used from the published or unpublished works of another person full reference must be made to the relevant sources. The use of a series of short extracts from different sources without reference to them constitutes equally serious plagiarism as copying, without citation, from one source, of a large excerpt. When a student summarises the ideas or opinions of a person, reference must be made to the name of that person in the text and the title of the relevant book, article or other work must be cited in the bibliography.\n",
